# üåû GUI Weather App

For my Year 2 GUI Module, I created a weather app using mainly JavaScript with React, HTML and CSS.\
The app shows the weather for certain time specified by a pre-entered timetable. On days where there are no events on the timetable, or after all events on the timetable have been completed, the normal hourly forecast is shown. Extra information for the hourly forecast can also be viewed when you click on the forecast icon.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è How to run the app:

In the project directory, you can run `npm start`.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.
