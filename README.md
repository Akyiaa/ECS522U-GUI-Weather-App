# 🌞 GUI Weather App

For my Year 2 GUI Module, I created a weather app using mainly JavaScript with React, HTML and CSS.


## 🌧️ Main features

#### 💧 Clothe Recommendations
The app recommends clothes to user depending on the temperature and general weather conditions

#### 💧 Timetable-Specific
The app shows the weather for certain times specified by a pre-entered timetable. On days where there are no events on the timetable, or after all events on the timetable have been completed, the normal hourly forecast is shown. 

#### 💧 Extra weather information
Extra information for the hourly forecast can also be viewed when you click on the forecast icon.\
Averaged extra weather information shown for events on the timetable

### Possible Future Additions
🌩️Ability to import personalised Timetables



## ❄️ How to run the app:

(Make sure to install the latest version of Node.js and npm as well as luxon (`npm i luxon`) in the directory folder)
In the project directory, you can run `npm start`.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.
